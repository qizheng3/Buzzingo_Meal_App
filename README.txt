In this project, we developed a multi-platform application named ‘Buzzingo Meal’ to help improve the campus dining experience. The name Buzzingo comes from Buzz and Bingo with our hope that this App could bring the GT community a pleasant surprise. 

There are four main objectives we want to achieve.
1) First of all, we want to make real-time menus and food information accessible to GT students, faculty and staff for all dining places across the campus.
2) Second, we want to include precise locations for campus restaurants with easy navigation via Google Maps.
3) Third, we want to provide detailed nutrition facts for the listed foods.
4) Finally, we want to help students better manage their diet by providing effective food nutrition profiling, and useful little tools such as daily calorie and essential nutrient
calculator.

There is a demo video to demonstrate the functionality of the App. Check it out :) 

Hope you find it useful!
